# models

This folder should contain a model that can be used to predict the media 
outlet (e.g. New York Times) of a news article based solely on its content. 
It is based on this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news) 
containing data from several U.S. media outlets from 2016 to 2017.
